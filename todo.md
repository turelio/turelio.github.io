fix linking in draw_hour_list for categories and subcategories
general refactor
add descriptions to main pages
rewrite build processes into building blocks instead of repeating same code every time (like in generator)
subcategory summaries (ex. sub-maintenance.html)
category summaries (cat-data.html)
date portal (starts with total summary, sublinks for years, then months)
add hidden accordion button with normal logs
read draw_summary (first/last log etc)
fix remaining logs, refile projects if needed
